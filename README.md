# Holding the number---HTML-CSS-JS
 // Responsive? R: Yes  // This is a game where the player has to roll the dice and hold the current score into the total score, then the score will be 0 and automatically change to player 2. When we roll a 1 we loose the score and the other player keeps playing. With that's been said, the goal is to achieve 100 points :)
